        <h1>Repairs Over Replacement</h1>
        <p>
          We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind.
          That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system before
          outright replacing it, wherever possible – it requires fewer materials
          and is easier on the planet, as well as your wallet! If another
          company tells you that your system needs to be replaced, just give us
          a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.

          As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come cheap.
          Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so we price
          ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable. We're
          focused on helping you and on helping the environment, rather than on
          turning a profit.

          As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the planet and
          about seeing people embrace a greener, more eco-friendly approach to
          power. The world of green energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so
          we want to help educate people on the big and little things they can
          do to protect our planet!
